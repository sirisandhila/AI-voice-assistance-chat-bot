🗣️ AI Voice Assistance
📘 Overview

AI Voice Assistance is an intelligent voice-based system designed to interact with users through natural language. It leverages speech recognition, natural language understanding (NLU), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies to provide real-time responses, perform tasks, and improve user accessibility.


🚀 Features

🎙️ Voice Recognition: Converts user speech to text using advanced ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition).

🧠 Natural Language Understanding: Interprets and processes user intent via NLP models.

🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Responds with natural and human-like synthesized speech.

🔄 Context Awareness: Maintains context for multi-turn conversations.

🌐 API Integration: Supports integration with external APIs (e.g., weather, smart home, reminders).

🧩 Customizable: Supports adding new commands, intents, or voices.

🕹️ Cross-Platform Support: Runs on web, mobile, or desktop platforms.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-voice-assistance.git
cd ai-voice-assistance
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate     # (Windows)
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add API Keys

Create a `.env` file and add your API credentials:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
GOOGLE_SPEECH_KEY=your_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the app at:
👉 **file:///C:/Users/sirig/Desktop/voice%20assistance/index.html**

🧩 Usage

1. **Start the voice assistant** by clicking the microphone button.
2. **Speak naturally** to give commands or ask questions.
3. The assistant will **process your voice input**, **generate a response**, and **speak back** to you.
4. Use commands like:

   * “What’s the weather today?”
   * “Set a reminder for 3 PM.”
   * “Turn off the living room lights.”



🧪 Example Response Flow

User: "What's the weather in London?"
↓
Speech-to-Text: "What's the weather in London?"
↓
NLU Engine → detects intent: "weather_query"
↓
Weather API → returns data
↓
Text-to-Speech → "The weather in London is 18°C and partly cloudy."
